                            <p>Ouarzazate, a city with a population of around 80,000, 
                                is the capital of its namesake province and sits at an altitude of 1,160 
                                meters between the High Atlas mountain ranges. Founded in 1928 as a small
                                 Berber settlement, it has grown into an important center for handicrafts 
                                 and trade due to its prime location. It serves as a major transportation hub 
                                 in southern Morocco and a popular tourist destination.
                                  A trip to Ouarzazate is a must for any vacation in Morocco. 
                                  The 200 km journey from Marrakech takes around 4 hours, 
                                  but it is recommended to allow more time due to the scenic route
                                   and sights along the way.

                                This UNESCO World Heritage Site is a collection of traditional earthen buildings, known as kasbahs, 
                                that rise dramatically from the desert landscape.  Wander its labyrinthine alleys, 
                                imagining life in bygone eras, and delve into the rich Berber heritage that thrives within its walls. 
                                Ksar Ait Ben Haddou has also served as a backdrop for numerous Hollywood films,

                            <p>The most important attraction right in the city of Ouarzazate is the impressive Kasbah Taourirt, a residential castle made of rammed earth, which was built in the early 20th century. This Kasbah is still very well-preserved and a third of it has been opened to the public for visits. Guided tours can be booked on site.</p>

 Excellent
It is "The Monument of Ouarzazate". This kasbah is located in the historic center of the old Ouarzazate, because the modern city has largely extended (There is no shortage of space in this desert area). Wide avenues for miles that make me think of an "American" city.
The Kasbah therefore called "kasbah of Taourirt", or even "kasbah of Glaoui", is now a museum which can be visited for its architecture, its skylight and its rooms with beautiful walls and sumptuous painted ceilings, but the whole is empty of furniture. Well restored, at least a large part, it has

Looks great on the Grand'Place, worthy of a presidential palace.</p>

Haggle for treasures like Berber crafts and textiles, savor mint tea in bustling cafes, and mingle with friendly locals.
